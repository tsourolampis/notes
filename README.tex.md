# Notes

Keeping notes related to teaching (CS131 Discrete Structures, CS591 Graph Analytics, CS591 Data Analytics), research and problem solving.

## Problems 

1.  Let $x,y$ be positive integers. Then, the equation $x^{-1}-y{-1}=n^{-1}$ has a *unique* solution for a given positive integer $n$ if and only if $n$ is a prime. 
2. Determine the term $a_{1984}$ where $a_0=1821, a_1=1912,\ldots,a_{n+2} = \frac{a_{n+1}+1}{a_n}$.
